# .portfolio


Hello! I started making .portfolio for the first ever WiCS Hacks, a 24-hour Hack-a-thon at the University of Texas.
I won an award for the design of my project, but even after the end of WiCS Hacks I have continued to work on functionality.

I went to HSPVA for high school, and as such many of my friends are artists.
I thought that .portfolio would be a cool project to share with them.
I want the main .html code to be a template that artists can use to have their own website to display their art.
